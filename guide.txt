This is the simple guide for hosting collaborative online testing on your own computer.

Requirements: 
You must have "Node.js" on your computer. if you are using Windows, downloading "Node.js" will also give you the "Node.js commend prompt.

Running:
1.download Git
2.Go to the directory in cmd
3.If this is first running, type `npm install`
4.Type `node index.js`
5.Go to a web browse and type `localhost:8888`
6.For collaborative example, you will need two different browses
7.The teacher’s account is “123” with password “admin”. The students’ accounts are “2000” with password “2000” and “3000” with password “3000”. You can create more accounts using teacher’s account. However, only students’ account can do the problem set, and the data will be recorded.


To create questions:
you need to update the json in `data/questions.json` in line 25, you need to define a unique string id for the question set id.
`name` is the displayed name of the question set id, this can be different from the unique string id.
`numOfQuestions` is the total number of questions each set has.
`isHidden` is a boolean value to determine whether we should display it in the page.
`questions` is an array of questions.
Each question will have `type` : 'singleChoice' | 'multipleChoice' | 'openQuestion',
`title`, `text`, `image`, `option`.
If the question set is collaborative, each question will also have `maxHintAllowedPerPerson`, `versionA`, `verionsB`, `hint` and `hintText`.

If you want add images: save your images to `../webapp/template/questions/asset`.
